Ciprés -- Code Intensive Presentations
======================================

I don't want to copy and paste code
into a PowerPointish tool.

I don't want to write HTML or LaTeX code
to prepare a presentation.

I don't want to waste time
choosing animations or color schemes.

I want to write the code
in my preferred text editor.

I want to be able to run the code
that I'm presenting.

I want to write unit tests
for my presentations.

I want to share my presentations
by handing executable code to you.

I just want to put
some standalone source files in a directory
and generate a presentation from them.

Ciprés will eventually do that for me.
For now it's just Yet Another Empty Github Project.
